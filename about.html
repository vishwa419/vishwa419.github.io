        <p class="intro-text">
            I'm an innovative <span class="highlight-text">Software Development Engineer</span> with a passion for building
            high-performance, <span class="highlight-text">scalable systems</span> that push the boundaries of data engineering
            and <span class="highlight-text">deep learning</span>. I specialize in creating <span class="highlight-text">intelligent
                systems</span> that turn raw data into actionable insights.
        </p>

        <div class="about-body">
            <p>
                With expertise in <span class="highlight-text">Python</span>, <span class="highlight-text">C++</span>, and <span
                    class="highlight-text">TensorFlow</span>, I have a strong foundation in both cloud-native systems and <span
                    class="highlight-text">AI/ML</span> technologies. My career has been built around leveraging cutting-edge tools
                and techniques to solve complex problems at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it's developing real-time data pipelines or deploying <span class="highlight-text">machine learning models</span>
                for predictive analytics, I thrive in challenging environments that demand high-throughput, low-latency solutions.
                I'm particularly excited by the opportunity to work on systems that use data to <span class="highlight-text">drive
                    innovation</span> and improve business outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working on mission-critical projectsâ€”from enhancing satellite data
                processing at the <span class="highlight-text">Indian Space Research Organization</span> to contributing to
                advanced ML research. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving and leadership abilities, preparing me
                for roles that demand excellence in both technical and collaborative work.
