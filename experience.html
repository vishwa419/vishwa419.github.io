              <ul>
                <li><strong>Developed SAT EYE - Real-Time Satellite Monitoring with Anomaly Detection:</strong> Contributed to the development of SAT EYE, a real-time ML-based satellite monitoring system using Django, Flask, and Dash. The system enabled continuous anomaly detection and monitoring of 70 satellite parameters, reducing the workload of domain experts by 40% and significantly improving system reliability and customer satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Researched and Designed a Novel Transformer Architecture for Anomaly Detection:</strong> Conducted research and designed a novel transformer architecture combined with contrastive learning to enhance the real-time monitoring of 65 satellite parameters. This innovation led to a 20% reduction in missed anomalies, especially for high-impact, low-frequency events, greatly improving the monitoring system's accuracy and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Developed a Forecasting and Anomaly Detection Framework:</strong> Developed a framework for parameter forecasting and anomaly detection using Bayesian estimates, advanced forecasting techniques, and unsupervised clustering. This solution streamlined processes, saving 40 hours per week for domain experts and enabling more accurate and timely anomaly detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Designed and Implemented a Scalable CCTV Data Processing Pipeline:</strong> Led the design and implementation of a CCTV data processing pipeline using Kafka, Go, and Django, capable of managing and processing over 3TB of CCTV data daily. This pipeline ensured real-time data ingestion, 24/7 monitoring of sensitive zones, and optimized data storage and retrieval, enhancing security operations across the organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Built a Self-Service CI/CD Platform:</strong> Designed and implemented a self-service CI/CD pipeline using Kubernetes, Git, Proxmox, and Calico. This solution facilitated Agile development by enabling on-demand scaling, automating deployments, and enforcing standardized security practices, leading to faster development cycles and enhanced deployment efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Developed and Optimized TAPAS:</strong> Led the development and optimization of TAPAS, a scalable data ingestion platform built with Kafka and Golang. This platform enabled real-time data flow from satellite antennas to 15 internal tools across five teams, with RBAC-based access control to ensure secure and efficient data management across the organization.</li>
